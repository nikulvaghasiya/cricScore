Live Cricket Score API üèè

unofficial API Data Fetched from `Cricbuzz.com`

This is an unofficial API and not Linked or Partnered with Any Brands/Company.

> Recently we shutdown our Free API Server due to bulk API Calls Personally we Suggest you to Self Host this API on your server - instant Deploy on Vercel and Heroku - <https://github.com/mskian/cri-deploy#free-deploy->  

## How it Works? ü§î

We are just fetching the data from Cricbuzz using PHP cURL `preg_match` and `preg_math_all`. It's kind of scraping but we are not storing any data or link in our end.

Everything is scraped live and shown to end users in realtime.

Example: **API URL üåê**

```sh
https://localhost:6001/cri.php?url=<Live Match URL>
```

## Requirements üìë

- Server with PHP Support  
- PHP 7.2 or 7.3 or 7.4 (Test upto PHP 8)
- PHP cURL  
- Nginx, Apache2 or  Lightspeed  
- HTTPS (For Secure SSL Connections)  

## Installation üçØ

- Download or Clone Repo to your Server

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mskian/cricket-api.git
cd cricket-api
cd cri
```

- Test the API

```sh
php -S localhost:6001
```

## Usage üçü

- Get the Live Match Score URL from - `https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-match/live-scores`
- Enter them Directly or replace `www` with `m`
